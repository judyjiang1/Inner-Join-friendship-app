# InnerJoin - Hackbright Capstone Project

## Overview

InnerJoin is an innovative social web application built upon the principles of the Similarity Attraction Theory, a social psychological concept that explains how people are naturally drawn to those who share important similarities with them. This unique web app allows users to discover and connect with individuals who reflect these similarities in their life experiences.

Staying true to its name, InnerJoin facilitates connections among people who share commonalities across various categories, including attending the same schools, working at the same companies, sharing common hobbies, cultural backgrounds, and life experiences. Users can effortlessly select their preferred categories and provide their information. Based on their choices, users are grouped with like-minded individuals in each category.

With a simple click, users can enter group chats, embarking on the journey of building lasting friendships. Additionally, users have the option to access a list of 'super match' group members â€” individuals who share at least two common groups with them, enhancing the potential for deeper connections.
